# shall_we_talk

This project is the final project for the course "SEP 758:Prototyping Tools (Mobile Applications)", It is a Mobile application developed using Flutter.

This app is related to our project in “SEP760 Design Thinking”, where we want to design an app which can be used by people with mental health problems to reach out to professionals for help. Those professionals include doctors, nurses, people with similar mental health problems but have fully recovered, or professional care givers with related knowledge on how to take care of those patients.

In the app, users are divided into two groups, with one being “normal users” (the patients) and another being “professionals”. With the app, the patients will be able to find suitable professionals to talk to by looking at their name, gender and self-introduction, and a professional will be able to find the personal information of the corresponding patient, so that they are able to know related backgrounds of the patient to provide appropriate help. Those information about the patient includes age and gender, also the map location so that in case of emergency, the professionals will be able to help them call an ambulance to send them to hospital. 

Thus the information of users needed would be name, username, password, gender, age, telephone number, self-introduction. These information will be provided when sign-up for the app. 

When login, the location of the user on the database will be updated, and the user can choose to do the location update when he move to another place by pressing the “location update” button on the home page.

On the home page, users can also choose to log out of the app by pressing the “Logout” button. 

The information of the patients can be viewed by pressing the “information icon” on the “userinfo” tile, which will lead to a Google map page, with the location of the patient shown. By clicking on the marker, the information of the patient (name, gender and age) will be shown. Also on the page, other google map functions (such as “directions” or “info about locations” etc.) can also be shown.

On the homepage, a patient can try to call a profession by pressing the “phone” icon, which will direct him/her to the native phone app, where he can dial out the number of the professional given by the app.
